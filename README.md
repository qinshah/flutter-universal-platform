# Universal Platform - A Web-safe Platform class

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/universal_platform.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/universal_platform)

Currently, if you include the _dart.io.Platform_ anywhere in your code, your app will throw the following error on Web:

```
Unsupported operation: Platform._operatingSystem
```

With this plugin you can perform platform detection on all platforms, including Web, without errors.

## 🔨 Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  universal_platform: ^1.0.0+1
```

### ⚙ Import

Remove any usages of _dart.io.Platform_, and replace with this:

```dart
import 'package:universal_platform/universal_platform.dart';
```

## 🕹️ Usage

This acts as a drop-in replacement for dart.io.Platform, with a different name for improved clarity.

```dart
//This will explode on Web
bool isIos = Platform.isIOS;

//This will not :)
bool isIos = UniversalPlatform.isIOS;
bool isWeb = UniversalPlatform.isWeb;
```
